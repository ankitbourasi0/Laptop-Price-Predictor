# Aim
This project aims to predict the Price of laptop by taking it configuration like HDD, SSD, Processor, Ram, and other parameters.

# Description
# What this project does? 


# How this project does?

The data was cleaned (it was super unclean :( ) and analysed.

done a some feature engineering,
then EDA comparing configuration with target price;

Then use Linear Regression model AND then many regression algorithms were used like Decisiono Tree, Random Forest and so on Random Forest was on top of them which had 0.87 R2_score.

This project was given the form of an website built on Streamlit where we used the Linear Regression,Decesion Tree, Random Forest Regressor models to perform predictions.
